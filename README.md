# LIRI Bot

### Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### How it works

1. LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

### Technology used

To retrieve the data that powers this app, the app sends requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. 

   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

   * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

     * The app uses Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)

   * [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
